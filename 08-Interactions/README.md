# Interactions 2 Days

In CSS we have 2 main ways of creating animations:

- `transition`
    - transition-duration
    - transition-property
    - transition-delay
    - transition-timing-function
- `animation` (keyframe animations)

## Properties that can be animated

- `transform`
    - translate
        - translateX()
        - translateY()
        - translate(x, y)
    - rotate
    - scale
    - ...
- transform-origin  
- `opacity`
- `background-color`
- others...


## Transition vs Animation

- transition: defines an animation between 2 states.
  - a starting point
  - and ending point

- animation: we can create more complex animations, defined in multiple steps
  - we could change the color of an element between 4, 5 or how many different colors we want
  - we can move an element from point 1 to point 2 then to point 3 and so on
