## About section

Hi there, my name is Nami. I'm a photographer based in Berlin, currently studying to become a full-stack web developer. I love front-end stuff, especially HTML/CSS. I am a naturally curious person and passionate about learning new technologies, that's why I'm studying the backend now. In my free time you can find me skating or playing with my cat.
