    <h1>Font Families: Serif, Sans-serif, and others</h1>
    <p>
      In CSS (and in typography in general) there are five basic types, or
      families, of fonts: serif, sans serif, cursive, fantasy, and monospace.
      Font Families: Serif, Sans-serif, Serif fonts have small lines or strokes
      that extend from the ends of characters. They can look like small feet,
      caps, tails, flags or dots. Serif fonts have been used for centuries in
      printed books, magazines and newspapers. Sans-serif fonts do not have
      serifs (“sans” is French for “without”). These fonts are simple and
      straightforward.
