        <h2>CSS font-family Property</h2>
        <p class="text-1">
          The font-family property is one of the most powerful CSS properties.
          It allows you to assign different fonts and font variants to textual
          elements on your website. With this property, you can use a single
          HTML element with multiple font faces instead of separate HTML
          elements for each variant. This makes your code more scalable, and
          accessible.

        <h2>Font Families: Serif, Sans-serif, and others</h2>
        <p class="text-2">
          In CSS (and in typography in general) there are five basic types, or
          families, of fonts: serif, sans serif, cursive, fantasy, and
          monospace. Font Families: Serif, Sans-serif, Serif fonts have small
          lines or strokes that extend from the ends of characters. They can
          look like small feet, caps, tails, flags or dots. Serif fonts have
          been used for centuries in printed books, magazines and newspapers.
          Sans-serif fonts do not have serifs (“sans” is French for “without”).
          These fonts are simple and straightforward.

      <section>
        <h2>What about cursive, fantasy, and monospace?</h2>
        <p class="text-3">
          These fonts are more difficult to read and should be used sparingly.
          Depending on the message or feeling you’re trying to communicate, they
          might be suitable for short sections of text, such as headings or
          subheadings.
