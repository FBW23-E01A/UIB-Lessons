        <h2>What is a CSS Unit?</h2>
        <p>
          1. Absolute Units: Units that are “absolute” are the same size
          regardless of the parent element or window size. This means a property
          set with a value that has an absolute unit will be that size when
          looked at on a phone or on a large monitor. Pixels px are typically
          the most popular absolute unit for screens.
        </p>

        <p>
          Relative Units: Relative units are useful for styling responsive sites
          because they scale relative to the parent or window size (depending on
          the unit). Relative units can be a little more difficult than absolute
          units in determining which to use, so let’s go through your options in
          detail.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s not always clear which of these options is best to use for each
          type of CSS property. For example, % is usually more appropriate for
          layout-related properties like width than it would be for font-size.
          Here are some examples of when you would use each relative unit: %:
          You want a child element to have 10% of the parent’s width as a margin
          so it never fills the whole parent element. If the parent’s size
          changes, the margin will update too.
        </p>

        How do we put
        <span style="color: blue">an image on a webpage?</span> Images
        <span style="color: brown">can improve</span> the design and the
        appearance of a web page. In order to put a simple image on a web page,
        we use the <img alt="test" /> element. This is requires two attributes
        to be useful: src and alt.
