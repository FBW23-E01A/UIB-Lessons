      The margin is an invisible space around your box. It pushes other elements
      away from the box. Margins can have positive or negative values. Setting a
      negative margin on one side of your box can cause it to overlap other
      things on the page. Whether you are using the standard or alternative box
      model, the margin is always added after the size of the visible box has
      been calculated.
