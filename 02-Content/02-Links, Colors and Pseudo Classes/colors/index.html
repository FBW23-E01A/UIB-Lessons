    <h1>What are HTML color codes?</h1>

    <p class="text-green">
      Color codes are ways of representing the colors we see everyday in a
      format that a computer can interpret and display. Commonly used in
      websites and other software applications, there are a diversity of
      formats, including Hex color codes, RGB and HSL values, and HTML color
      names, amongst others.

    <h2>CSS Color Values</h2>
    <p class="text-red">With CSS, colors can be set by using color names</p>

    <h2>Hexadecimal values (HEX)</h2>
    <pre>
Hexadecimal color values are also supported in all browsers.

A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB.
        
RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) are hexadecimal integers between 00 and FF specifying the intensity of the color.
        
For example, #0000FF is displayed as blue, because the blue component is set to its highest value (FF) and the others are set to 00.
    </pre>

    <h2>RGB Colors</h2>
    <p class="rgb">
      RGB color values are supported in all browsers. An RGB color value is
      specified with: rgb( RED , GREEN , BLUE ). Each parameter defines the
      intensity of the color as an integer between 0 and 255. For example,
      rgb(0,0,255) is rendered as blue, because the blue parameter is set to its
      highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.
