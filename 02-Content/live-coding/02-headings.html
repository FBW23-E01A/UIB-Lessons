    <h1>Galton Bridge</h1>
    <p>
      The Galton Bridge is a cast-iron bridge in Smethwick, near Birmingham, in
      central England. Opened in 1829 as a road bridge, the structure has been
      pedestrianised since the 1970s. It was built by Thomas Telford to carry a
      road across the new main line of the Birmingham Canal, which was built in
      a deep cutting. The bridge is 70 ft (21 m) above the canal, making it
      reputedly the highest single-span arch bridge in the world when it was
      built, 26 ft (7.9 m) wide, and 150 ft (46 m) long.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      The original Birmingham Canal was built from the late 1760s along a
      meandering route, connecting Birmingham to Wolverhampton via the Black
      Country coalfields. One of the major obstacles on the route was a patch of
      high ground at Smethwick, roughly 4 mi (6.4 km) west of Birmingham. The
      engineers had originally planned to tunnel through, but discovered that
      the ground conditions were not suitable. Thus, the canal was carried over
      the hill by a flight of locks.

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>The bridge is a single span of 150 ft (46 m), 26 ft (8 m) wide and 70 ft (20 m) above the canal. It consists of six cast-iron ribs, each made of seven segments, bolted together. The bridge is supported by tall brick abutments built into the valley sides. The deck plate is supported by X-shaped bracing in the spandrels. Telford added a decorative parapet and lamp-posts, also in cast iron.</p>
