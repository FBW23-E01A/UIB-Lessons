# Size it up!

**Instructions**: 
* Set the base font size of the page in `rem` using the `:root` selector. 
* In rem, set a font size for each paragraph element using their classes to select them. Make the font size represent the size description (small, medium, large etc.).
* Set a font size for the footer.
* Adjust the font size of the `description` class which should be **relative** to the footer.
